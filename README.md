# 100-Days-of-Code-The-Complete-Python-Pro-Bootcamp

Day 1:
- Downloaded the pycharm apk file and installed it.
- \n is used to print the statement in multiple lines
- Concatenation - print("Hello" + " " + "world"); -> o/p = Hello world
- Indentation is very import - if we don't use the spaces accurately, we might end up with some error.
- print(".......")
- input("Takes an input from the user using the prompt")

- Python Variables:
- The variables can be named directly
- Example -> likhitha = "Rai"

- Len() function - to find the length of a string
- We cannot concat a string with a number in python -> Throws the error - TypeError: can only concatenate str (not "int") to str
- We need to convert number to string first and then conact it with an string
